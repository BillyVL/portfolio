Simple portfolio website made with HTML and CSS.

This website helped me learn and practice the following: semantic containers (main, article, footer), 
styled links using pseudo classes, various headers, absolute & relative links, and many different CSS properties. 

Thank you to the Thinkful Engineering Flex program for their guidance and support.
