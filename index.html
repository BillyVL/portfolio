    <h2>About Billy</h2>
    <p class = "aboutParagraphs">I graduated UC Davis with a degree in Computer Science and decided to continue my education in the Thinkful Engineering Flex program. 
                                 I currently have a part-time job as a STEM instructor for kids in after-school programs and love to teach others. As a student, I am motivated
                                 to land a job in the tech industry and to continuously learn and eventually become a full-stack developer. Thinkful will be apart of this amazing 
                                 journey and I'm excited about what the future holds for me!
